### Original Documentation

These PDFs are scans of original design notes created between 1982-84 during the development of Quicksilva Battlezone.

Generally, the Z80 code was written down, tested by hand, and typed into a Spectrum assembler. Some (less complex) code was written straight into the assembler and the source probably no longer exists. Also amongst these scans are diagrams, comments and miscellaneous detritus from the design process.

Note that I was 17-18 when I wrote most of this, and Battlezone was the first big program I'd ever written. You've been warned.

Also note that I'm reading the titles and some of the symbols in the code to figure out what it does in the descriptions below. Don't take it as gospel though - it might be misleading. I didn't expect anyone would ever read these notes again, let alone put them on public display!

* Red book [part 1](docs/Red+book+scan1.pdf), [part 2](docs/'Red+book+scan2.pdf'): Most of the code from 1983 was done in a red exercise book, scanned here in two parts for manageability. The quality is a bit low, because the spring binder somewhat jammed the scanner open - sorry. It should be adequate.

* Not sure, probably some long-division code: [DIV.pdf](docs/DIV.pdf)
* To be figured out! : [Eraser+Scanner.pdf](docs/Eraser+Scanner.pdf)
* Some fixed global memory location symbols: [Mem-locations.pdf](docs/Mem-locations.pdf)
